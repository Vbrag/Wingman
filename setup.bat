This function works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted.

The pivot is chosen to be the middle element of the array. This ensures that the array is always divided into two roughly equal parts.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n) in the average case, but can degrade to O(n^2) in the worst case (when the input is already sorted).

//This function is used to convert gray code to binary.
//Gray code is a binary code system in which two successive values differ in only one bit.
//The gray code of a binary number is obtained by flipping the bits of the binary number and then adding one to the result.
//For example, the gray code of 00 is 0 and the gray code of 01 is 1, 10 is 2, and 11 is 3.
//The gray code of a binary number is obtained by flipping the bits of the binary number and then adding one to the result. 


#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>

LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(0x27,16,2); // I2C address of the LCD, number of columns, number of rows

void setup() {
  lcd.begin(16,2); // Initialize the lcd  lcd.print("Hallo World"); // Write "Hallo World" to the lcd}

void loop() {
  // Nothing to do}
```

This code will display "Hallo World" on the LCD.

Please note that you need to replace the I2C address of the LCD with the one that is connected to your Arduino. The I2C address of the LCD is usually 0x27.

Also, the number of columns and rows of the LCD are specified in the `lcd.begin(16,2);` line. The number of columns and rows can be adjusted according to your specific LCD.

The `lcd.print("Hallo World");` line will write "Hallo World" to the LCD.

Please make sure that the LCD is connected to the I2C bus of your Arduino and that the necessary libraries are included in your code.
